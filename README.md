Qlinqo
======

Qlinqo is an HTML5 Game similar to Plinko on the Price is Right, drop your game piece and try to get it into a high-scoring slot!

If you get a score above 20,000 you are given a nice fireworks show, the more points you get the more fireworks you’ll see.

Qlinqo uses <a href="https://github.com/mpalmerlee/Stratiscape">Stratiscape</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/">Box2dWeb</a> for the physics engine.
